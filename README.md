# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LlamaIndex and Azure OpenAI
LlamaIndex is a popular framework for building RAG solutions, thanks to its tools which provide abstraction for data connectors, indexes and processing engines. You will find a Jupyter notebook in this repo, that utilises LlamaIndex and Azure OpenAI models (GPT-4 and Embedding) to answer queries with pre-indexed in-memory content.

To build this demo, I used the latest version of LlamaIndex (v0.10.19 at the time of writing). To upgrade your _llama-index_ Python package, please use the following pip command:
```
pip install --upgrade llama-index
```
